### What I learned

Postitioning became a real challenge in this one, especially trying to line up the background spheres. I'm not confident that I did it the best way, but the end result seemed to work.

Also, doing multiple Flexbox areas became a challenge trying to keep them all straight. Trying to figure out how to create the three sections of the card was also challenging. Again, not sure I figured out the best way, but a way where it reached the end result.
