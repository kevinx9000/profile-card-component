## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Google Fonts
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Desktop-first workflow
- Mobile breakpoint

### What I learned

Postitioning became a real challenge in this one, especially trying to line up the background spheres.

Also, doing multiple Flexbox areas became a challenge trying to keep them all straight. Trying to figure out how to create the three sections of the card was also challenging.
